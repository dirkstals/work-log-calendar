# work-log-calendar

> A visual representation of the system logs from your computer.

See the time you actually spend on your computer. It creates time slots based on the activities of your computer.
On Mac it is a combination of shutdown events and the moment at which the display is switched on and off.
Windows has a different logging system and therefore it combines a bunch of events. You might get a more detailed view when you have administrator rights.
